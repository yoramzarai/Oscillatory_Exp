# Computing the exponent of oscillatory matrices
A Python tool to compute the exponent of an oscillatory matrix. See [notebook](https://github.com/yoramzarai/Oscillatory_Exp/blob/master/OSC_exp.ipynb) for details and implementation.


## Function
- TP_TN_OSC_funcs.py contains several functions related to the number of sign variations in a vector, multiplicative compound matrices, SEB factorization, planar networks and other TP/TN/OSC matrices related functions.

## Notebook
- OSC_exp.ipynb uses the triangle graph (derived from the planar networks of an SEB factorization) to deduce the exponent of an oscillatory matrix $A$, and to compute the families of vertex-disjoint paths of each corner minor of $A^r$, where $r$ is the exponent of $A$.
