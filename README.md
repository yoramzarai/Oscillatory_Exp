# Computing the exponent of oscillatory matrices
A Python tool to compute the exponent of an oscillatory matrix. See [notebook](https://github.com/yoramzarai/Oscillatory_Exp/blob/master/osc_matrix_exponent_examples.ipynb) for details and examples.


## Modules
- TP_TN_OSC_funcs.py contains several functions related to the number of sign variations in a vector, multiplicative compound matrices, SEB factorization, planar networks and other TP/TN/OSC matrices related functions.
- osc_mat_exp.py contains the functions to compute the exponent of an oscillatory matrix.

## Notebook
- osc_matrix_exponent_example.ipynb contains examples of using the triangle graph (derived from the planar networks of an SEB factorization) to deduce the exponent of an oscillatory matrix ![A](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A), and to compute the families of vertex-disjoint paths of each corner minor of ![A^r](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A%5Er), where ![r](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r) is the exponent of ![A](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A).
